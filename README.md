# Make Change Project - Skill Distillery

## Description
This program takes in a (double) item price and (double) amount paid for the item, and it will tell the user what the appropriate change for that purchase would be in dollars/cents USD currency.

The program runs in a loop, and can be replayed by typing any character other than 'n' into the console when prompted after receiving the change.
## Lessons Learned
The biggest lesson learned from this program was the imprecision of doubles and working with them. The initial intent was to deal with doubles throughout the program, but that led to imprecision in the change amounts.

Another lesson learned was the usefulness of a boolean value to denote something that can only be true or false. In this case, a boolean called multiple was used to denote if there is more than one unit of currency being issued as change. This allowed for correct formatting of the change sentence.
